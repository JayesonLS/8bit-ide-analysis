# TEMU and VSB source code license terms

## Public Domain, but attribution appreciated

TEMU (Tandy Emulator) and VSB (Virtual Sound Blaster) were originally written in the '90s by Andrew Zabolotny (Андрей Заболотный), who has since graciously decided to release the source code of both utilities into the public domain. All he reasonably asks for in return is his continued attribution for this work.

> *When I have released the sources I had no good knowledge about open-source licenses and such things :)*<br/>
> *Consider them public domain, but I will be grateful if you keep my attribution somewhere.*
